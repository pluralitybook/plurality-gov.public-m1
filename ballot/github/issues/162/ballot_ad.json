The vertical axis can roughly reference the richness of information associated to each participant (scalar, vector, semi-structured text, natural language, single sense, multisensory, proprioception, telepathy) and the horizontal can roughly index the number of randomly chosen full participant human equivalents in orders of magnitude from just a few to billions and beyond.","choices":["prioritize"],"strategy":"qv","participants_group":"everybody","frozen":false,"closed":true,"cancelled":false,"parent_commit":"e23464a3d9b7a3b82b9888b7bb0204ffed873ede"}
